# Caesar Cipher Python Script

This Python script implements a Caesar cipher, a basic encryption technique. The Caesar cipher involves shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/openapi4/Caesar-Cipher-in-CLI.git
   ```
   or download the code directly to your system from GitHub.


3. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd caesar-cipher
   ```
4. Run the script using Python.
   
   ```bash
   python caesar_cipher.py
   ```
   The script will prompt you to enter the text you want to encrypt and the shift value.

   The encrypted and decrypted text will be displayed.

**Example**
   ```bash
   Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:
   encode
   Type your message:
   Hello World!
   Type the key (shift number):
   3
   Here&apos;s the encoded result: khoor zruog!
   With key = 3
   ```
